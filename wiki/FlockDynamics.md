# Flock Dynamics, Optimization and entropy

In this section we will explore the Vicsek model and how the entropy of the distribution changes over time. The Vicsek model is a minimalist set of rules that describe the behaviour of particles. The position and the orientation of the motion depend on the neighbors. There are interesting cases for high density and low noise in the orientation the particles move like one, for high noise every particle moves independently.

We implemented the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): leverage a swarm of particles that share information about local optimal points to find the global optimum.
