# A very brief introduction to Information Theory

Information Theory is a mathematical framework to study quantitatively digital information. In 1948, Claude Shannon wrote a paper titled "A mathemathical thoery of communication" [2] and it is considered the origin of information theory. In his work, Shannon defines entropy:
$ H(p) = - \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \log(p_i)$
