# Dimensionality and Information Theory

From the physics point of view, we can tie dimensionality with degrees of freedom. Doyne Farmer presents the intuitive notion of dimension in his 
beautiful article [Information Dimension and the structure of chaos](https://zfn.mpdl.mpg.de/data/Reihe_A/37/ZNA-1982-37a-1304.pdf). Intuitively, 
dimension captures three important notions:
- Direction: Topologica dimension
- Capacity: Fractal dimension
- Measure: Information dimension

The volume of a d-ball of radius R in a p-norm is:

In the figure below we can see the ratio of the volumes of d-ball and d-cube for different dimensions and values of p. Note how for finite values of p, the ratio tends to zero. This is connected to the curse of dimensionality since it implies that most of the volume is located outside the d-ball making the data space extremely sparse as we increase the number of dimensions.
