# Dimensionality and Information Theory

From the physics point of view, we can tie dimensionality with degrees of freedom. Doyne Farmer presents the intuitive notion of dimension in his 
beautiful article [Information Dimension and the structure of chaos](https://zfn.mpdl.mpg.de/data/Reihe_A/37/ZNA-1982-37a-1304.pdf). Intuitively, 
dimension captures three important notions:
- Direction: Topologica dimension
- Capacity: Fractal dimension
- Measure: Information dimension
