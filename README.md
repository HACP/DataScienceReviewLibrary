# Data Science Review Library

In this repo, we will explore common strategies and tools to attach data science problems. From exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, model selection, evaluation, pipeline and story telling, among others. 

We use the Titanic data set as our use case and build a library of functions in python to streamline the approach. Additionally, we build a wiki with in-depth explanation of concepts, tools and algorithms. We are using unit testig framework - a basic version. 

There is a plethora of blogs, articles about these topics. This repo is intended as a personal approach to data science problems that can be reused and expanded over time.
